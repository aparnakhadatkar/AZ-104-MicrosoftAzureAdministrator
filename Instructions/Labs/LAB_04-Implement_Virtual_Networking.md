### Task 4: Configure public and private Azure DNS zones

In this task, you will create and configure public and private DNS zones to enable efficient name resolution for resources in Azure. Public DNS zones will handle domain name resolution accessible over the internet, while private DNS zones will facilitate name resolution within your private virtual network, ensuring seamless communication between internal resources.

### Configure a public DNS zone

You can configure Azure DNS to resolve host names in your public domain. For example, if you purchased the contoso.xyz domain name from a domain name registrar, you can configure Azure DNS to host the `contoso.com` domain and resolve www.contoso.xyz to the IP address of your web server or web app.

1. In the Azure portal, search for and select **DNS zones**.

1. Select **+ Create**.

1. Configure the **Basics** tab.

    | Property | Value    |
    |:---------|:---------|
    | Subscription | **Select your subscription**  (1)|
    | Resource group |  **az104-04-rg1-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" />**(2) |
    | Name | **contoso<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" />.com** (3)|
    | Region | **<inject key="Region" enableCopy="false" />** (4)|

    ![image](../media/l4i11.png)

1. Select **Review create** and then **Create**.
   
1. Wait for the DNS zone to deploy and then select **Go to resource**.

1. On the **Overview** blade  select **Recordsets** and notice the names of the four Azure DNS name servers assigned to the zone. **Copy** one of the name server addresses. You will need it in a future step. 

    ![image](../media/l4i12.png)

1. Select **+ Add**. You add a virtual network link record for each virtual network that needs private name-resolution support.

    | Property | Value    |
    |:---------|:---------|
    | Name | **www** |
    | Type | **A - IPv4 Address records** |
    | TTL | **1** |
    | IP address | **10.1.1.4** |

     >**Note:**  In a real-world scenario, you'd enter the public IP address of your web server.

1. Select **Add** and verify **contoso<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" />.com** has an A record set named **www**.

   ![image](../media/l4i13.png)

1. Open a command prompt, and run the following command:
   In the below code, replace [DID] with **<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" />** and [name server name] with the **name server name** you copied in the previous step.
 
    ```sh
   nslookup www.contoso[DID].com [name server name]
   ```
1. Verify the host name **www.contoso<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" />.com** resolves to the IP address you provided. This confirms name resolution is working correctly.

    ![image](../media/l4i14.png)

###  Configure a private DNS zone

A private DNS zone provides name resolution services within virtual networks. A private DNS zone is only accessible from the virtual networks that it is linked to and can't be accessed from the internet. 

1. In the portal, search for and select **Private dns zones** resource.

1. Select **+ Create**.

1. On the **Basics** tab of Create private DNS zone, enter the information as listed in the table below:

    | Property | Value    |
    |:---------|:---------|
    | Subscription | **Select your subscription** |
    | Resource group | **az104-04-rg1-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" />** |
    | Name | `private.contoso.com` (adjust if you have to rename) |
    | Region | **<inject key="Region" enableCopy="false" />** |

1. Select **Review create** and then **Create**.
   
1. Wait for the DNS zone to deploy and then select **Go to resource**.

1. Notice on the **Overview** blade there are no name server records. 

1. In the left navigation pane under **DNS Management**, select **Virtual network links** from the left navigation pane and then select **+ Add**.

    | Property | Value    |
    |:---------|:---------|
    | Link name | **manufacturing-link**|
    | Virtual network |**ManufacturingVnet**|

1. Select **Create** and wait for the link to create. 

1. From the left navigation pane, under DNS Management click on **Record Set**. Click on **+ Add** to  add a record for each virtual machine that needs private name-resolution support.

    | Property | Value    |
    |:---------|:---------|
    | Name | **sensorvm** |
    | Type | **A** |
    | TTL | **1** |
    | IP address | **10.1.1.4** |
   
    >**Note:**  In a real-world scenario, you'd enter the IP address for a specific manufacturing virtual machine

1. Click on **Add**
