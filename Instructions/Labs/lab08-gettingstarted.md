# AZ-104: Microsoft Azure Administrator Workshop

Welcome to your AZ-104: Microsoft Azure Administrator workshop! We've prepared a seamless environment for you to explore and learn Azure Services. Let's begin by making the most of this experience.

# Lab 08 - Manage Virtual Machines

### Overall Estimated Duration: 50 minutes

## Overview

This lab focuses on deploying and managing Azure virtual machines (VMs) and Virtual Machine Scale Sets (VMSS). The lab covers tasks like deploying zone-resilient VMs using the Azure portal, managing compute and storage scaling for VMs, and configuring VMSS across availability zones for high availability and scalability. You'll also learn to create and scale VMSS, configure load balancing, and apply custom autoscale rules based on performance metrics like CPU usage. Optional tasks involve creating VMs using Azure PowerShell or CLI, with the lab providing hands-on experience in automating VM scaling and ensuring optimal resource management in Azure environments.

## Objective

1. **Deploy Azure Virtual Machines (VMs) and Configure Zone-Resilience**: Deploy Azure VMs and configure them to be zone-resilient using the Azure portal, ensuring that the VMs are distributed across multiple availability zones for improved fault tolerance.

2. **Manage Compute and Storage Scaling**: Manage the scaling of both compute and storage resources for Azure VMs to meet performance and availability requirements, ensuring optimal resource allocation under varying load conditions.

3. **Create and Scale Virtual Machine Scale Sets (VMSS)**: Create and scale Virtual Machine Scale Sets (VMSS) across availability zones, improving high availability and scalability by automatically distributing workloads across multiple zones.

4. **Configure Load Balancing and Autoscaling**: Configure load balancing and enable autoscaling based on performance metrics such as CPU usage, ensuring that resources are efficiently managed to meet demand while maintaining high availability.

## Pre-requisites

A basic understanding of virtual networks and subnetting will assist in configuring networking settings for VMs and VMSS.

## Architecture  

In this hands-on lab, the architecture flow includes several essential components.

1. Virtual Machines (VMs) and Virtual Machine Scale Sets (VMSS): Learn how to set up individual VMs and configure VMSS for automatic scaling based on demand.

2. High Availability and Fault Tolerance: Configure Azure's Availability Zones and Scale Sets to minimize downtime and improve the resilience of your infrastructure.

3. Load Balancing and Autoscaling: Autoscaling automatically adjusts the number of running instances to match demand, ensuring optimal performance and cost efficiency.

4. Azure Networking and Security Configuration: Configure virtual networks, subnets, and network security groups to control traffic flow and ensure secure communication between resources within your Azure environment.

## Explanation of Components

1. **Virtual Machine Scale Sets (VMSS)**: VMSS allows you to deploy and manage a set of identical, load-balanced VMs that can automatically scale up or down based on demand.

2. **Availability Zones**: Availability Zones are physical data centers within an Azure region designed to be independent of one another.

3. **Azure Load Balancer**: The Azure Load Balancer distributes network traffic evenly across multiple instances of VMs, ensuring high availability and reliability of your applications.
