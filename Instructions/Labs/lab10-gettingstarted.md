# AZ-104: Microsoft Azure Administrator Workshop

Welcome to your AZ-104: Microsoft Azure Administrator workshop! We've prepared a seamless environment for you to explore and learn Azure Services. Let's begin by making the most of this experience.

# Lab 10 - Implement Data Protection

### Overall Estimated Duration: 50 minutes

## Overview

In this lab, you learn how to implement data protection in Azure by focusing on backup and disaster recovery solutions. You provision infrastructure by deploying virtual machines, create a Recovery Services vault to manage backup data, and configure Azure virtual machine-level backup using customized policies. You monitor Azure Backup to track job statuses and enable replication for disaster recovery using Azure Site Recovery.

## Objective

In this lab, you will complete tasks related to backing up and recovering Azure virtual machines, as well as configuring disaster recovery using Azure Site Recovery.

1. **Provision Infrastructure**: Deploy virtual machines for testing backup and recovery scenarios.

2. **Create and Configure Recovery Services Vault**: Set up a Recovery Services vault to manage backup and recovery operations for Azure virtual machines. 

3. **Implement Azure Virtual Machine-Level Backup**: Configure backup policies for Azure virtual machines and perform a backup operation.

4. **Enable Virtual Machine Replication for Disaster Recovery**: Set up and enable virtual machine replication using Azure Site Recovery to protect against potential disasters.

## Pre-requisites

Basic understanding of backup and disaster recovery concepts: Awareness of backup policies, data protection strategies, and disaster recovery solutions.

## Architecture

1. **Configuring Azure Backup**: Creating and configuring backup policies to define backup frequency, retention, and recovery options.

2. **Enabling Azure Virtual Machine Backup**: Monitoring the backup status and ensuring that backup jobs are successfully completed.

3. **Restoring Data**: Testing the backup process by initiating a restore operation for Azure VMs, ensuring that data can be recovered from the backup points.

4. **Implementing Disaster Recovery**: Performing a failover operation to test the disaster recovery setup, ensuring business continuity in case of a failure.

## Explanation of Components

1. **Azure Recovery Services Vault**: A management entity in Azure that stores recovery data, such as backups and replication data.

2. **Backup Policies**: Define the rules and schedules for automating the backup process.

3. **Azure Site Recovery (ASR)**: A disaster recovery solution that ensures business continuity by replicating workloads across different Azure regions or on-premises to Azure.

4. **Recovery Points**: Snapshots or versions of your data captured during a backup.They act as checkpoints from which you can restore a VM or its data in case of data loss or corruption.
