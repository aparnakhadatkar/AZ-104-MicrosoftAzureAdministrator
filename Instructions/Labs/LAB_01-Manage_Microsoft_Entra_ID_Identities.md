# Lab 01 - Manage Microsoft Entra ID Identities

## Lab Overview

This lab focuses on users and groups as the foundation of an identity solution. You'll work on provisioning users and groups for a pre-production lab environment, incorporating automated group memberships based on job titles to streamline management.

## Interactive lab simulation

This lab uses an interactive lab simulation. The simulation lets you to click through a similar scenario at your own pace. There are differences between the interactive simulation and this lab, but many of the core concepts are the same. An Azure subscription is not required.

>**Note:** This simulation is being updated. Microsoft Entra ID is the new name for Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). 

+ [Manage Entra ID Identities](https://mslabs.cloudguides.com/guides/AZ-104%20Exam%20Guide%20-%20Microsoft%20Azure%20Administrator%20Exercise%201). Create and configure users and assign to groups. Create an Azure tenant and manage guest accounts. 

## Lab objectives
In this lab, you will complete the following tasks:

+ Task 1: Create and configure Entra ID users
+ Task 2: Create Entra ID groups with assigned and dynamic membership
+ Task 3: Create a Microsoft Entra ID tenant
+ Task 4: Manage Entra ID guest users

## Exercise 1: Microsoft Entra ID Identities
