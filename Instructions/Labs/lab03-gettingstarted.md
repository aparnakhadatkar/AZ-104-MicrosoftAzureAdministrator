# AZ-104: Microsoft Azure Administrator Workshop

Welcome to your AZ-104: Microsoft Azure Administrator workshop! We've prepared a seamless environment for you to explore and learn Azure Services. Let's begin by making the most of this experience.

# Lab 3 - Manage Azure resources by Using ARM Templates

### Overall Estimated Duration: 60 minutes

## Overview

In this lab, you will learn to manage Azure resources using Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates, enabling efficient and repeatable deployments. You will start by creating a managed disk via the Azure portal and exporting the deployment as a reusable template. Next, you will edit the template to redeploy resources, showcasing its flexibility for iterative deployments. You will configure the Azure Cloud Shell to deploy templates using Azure PowerShell and the CLI, demonstrating command-line automation for resource management. Finally, you will work with Azure Bicep to deploy resources, leveraging its declarative syntax for simplified infrastructure management.

## Objective

By the end of this lab you will learn the following key concepts:

1. **Create and Export ARM Templates**: Understand how to create and export Azure Resource Manager templates from existing deployed resources for reuse.

2. **Edit and Redeploy Templates**: Learn to modify ARM templates and redeploy them efficiently to manage resources effectively.

3. **Configure Cloud Shell for Deployment**: Set up Azure Cloud Shell to deploy templates using PowerShell and CLI commands for streamlined management.

4. **Explore Azure Bicep**: Gain experience in using Azure Bicep to define and deploy resources with a declarative approach.

## Pre-requisites

 Understanding of Azure Resource Manager (ARM) concepts, such as templates, parameters, and deployments, will be helpful.

 ## Architecture

In this hands-on lab, the architecture flow includes several essential components.

1. **Creating and Managing Resources with ARM Templates**: Create and deploy resources using Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates and explore how templates simplify resource deployment and management.

2. **Editing and Redeploying Templates**: Edit existing ARM templates to modify resource configurations and redeploy them, ensuring easy resource management and repeatability.

3. **Deploying Resources via Cloud Shell and PowerShell**: Configure Azure Cloud Shell and use Azure PowerShell to deploy ARM templates, giving you hands-on experience with scripting and automation.

4. **Exploring Azure Bicep for Resource Deployment**: Explore Azure Bicep, a declarative language used to define and deploy Azure resources, providing a more streamlined alternative to ARM templates.

## Explanation of Components

1. **Azure Resource Manager (ARM) Templates**: ARM templates are JSON files used to define the structure of your resources in Azure. They allow for the declarative deployment and management of resources in a repeatable manner.

2. **Cloud Shell**: Azure Cloud Shell is an integrated, browser-accessible command-line interface (CLI) that allows you to manage your Azure resources directly from the portal, offering both Bash and PowerShell environments.

3. **Azure PowerShell**: Azure PowerShell is a set of cmdlets used for managing Azure resources through scripts. In this lab, it’s used to deploy ARM templates, making resource management more efficient and automated.

4. **Azure Bicep**: Azure Bicep is a domain-specific language that simplifies the authoring of Azure ARM templates. It provides a more concise syntax while maintaining full compatibility with ARM templates for resource deployment.
