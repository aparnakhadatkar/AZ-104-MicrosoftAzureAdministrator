# Lab 3d - Manage Azure resources by Using Azure CLI-not in use
## Lab scenario
Now that you explored the basic Azure administration capabilities associated with provisioning resources and organizing them based on resource groups by using the Azure portal, Azure Resource Manager templates, and Azure PowerShell, you need to carry out the equivalent task by using Azure CLI. To avoid installing Azure CLI, you will leverage the Bash environment available in Azure Cloud Shell.

## Lab objectives
In this lab, you will complete the following tasks:
+ Task 1: Start a Bash session in Azure Cloud Shell
+ Task 2: Use the existing resource group and create an Azure managed disk by using Azure CLI
+ Task 3: Configure the managed disk by using Azure CLI

## Estimated timing: 20 minutes

## Excercise 1: Manage Azure resources by Using Azure CLI

### Task 1: Start a Bash session in Azure Cloud Shell
In this task, you will open a Bash session in Cloud Shell. 

1. From the portal, open the **Azure Cloud Shell** by clicking on the icon in the top right of the Azure Portal.

1. If prompted to select either **Bash** or **PowerShell**, select **Bash**.

   **Note**: If this is the first time you are starting **Cloud Shell** and you are presented with the **You have no storage mounted** message, select the subscription you are using in this lab, and click **Show Advanced Settings**.   

    >Under **Advanced Settings**, you need to select an existing resource group from the **Resource group(1)** dropdown and give some unique name under the **Storage Account(2)** section, and under the **File share(3)** section type none as shown in the below image.

1. Click **Create storage(4)**, and wait until the Azure Cloud Shell pane is displayed. 

1. Ensure **Bash** appears in the drop-down menu in the upper-left corner of the Cloud Shell pane.

### Task 2: Use the existing resource group and create an Azure managed disk by using Azure CLI
In this task, you will use the existing resource group for creating the Azure managed disk by using the Azure CLI session within Cloud Shell.

1. From the Bash session within Cloud Shell, run the following commands:

   ```sh
   LOCATION=$(az group show --name 'az104-03c-rg1-DeploymentID' --query location --out tsv)

   RGNAME='az104-03d-rg1-DeploymentID'
   ```
   >**Note**: Replace the DeploymentID in the above CLI command with the **<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>**

1. To retrieve properties of the created resource group, run the following:

   ```sh
   az group show --name $RGNAME
   ```
1. To create a new managed disk with the same characteristics as those you created in the previous labs of this module, from the Bash session within Cloud Shell, run the following:

   ```sh
   DISKNAME='az104-03d-disk1'

   az disk create \
   --resource-group $RGNAME \
   --name $DISKNAME \
   --sku 'Standard_LRS' \
   --size-gb 32
   ```
    >**Note**: When using multi-line syntax, ensure that each line ends with back-slash (`\`) with no trailing spaces and that there are no leading spaces at the beginning of each line.

1. To retrieve the properties of the newly created disk, run the following:

   ```sh
   az disk show --resource-group $RGNAME --name $DISKNAME
   ```

### Task 3: Configure the managed disk by using Azure CLI
In this task, you will be the managing configuration of the Azure managed disk by using the Azure CLI session within Cloud Shell. 

1. To increase the size of the Azure managed disk to **64 GB**, from the Bash session within Cloud Shell, run the following:

   ```sh
   az disk update --resource-group $RGNAME --name $DISKNAME --size-gb 64
   ```

1. To verify that the change took effect, run the following:

   ```sh
   az disk show --resource-group $RGNAME --name $DISKNAME --query diskSizeGB
   ```

1. To change the disk performance SKU to **Premium_LRS**, from the Bash session within Cloud Shell, run the following:

   ```sh
   az disk update --resource-group $RGNAME --name $DISKNAME --sku 'Premium_LRS'
   ```

1. To verify that the change took effect, run the following:

   ```sh
   az disk show --resource-group $RGNAME --name $DISKNAME --query sku
   ```
