# Lab 06 - Implement Traffic Management

## Lab Overview

In this lab, you will learn to configure and manage Azure resources, including Virtual Networks, Load Balancers, Virtual Machines, and Network Security Groups, to create a secure and scalable infrastructure.

## Interactive lab simulations

There are interactive lab simulations that you might find useful for this topic. The simulation lets you to click through a similar scenario at your own pace. There are differences between the interactive simulation and this lab, but many of the core concepts are the same. An Azure subscription is not required.

+ [Create and configure and Azure load balancer](https://mslabs.cloudguides.com/guides/AZ-700%20Lab%20Simulation%20-%20Create%20and%20configure%20an%20Azure%20load%20balancer). Create a virtual network, backend servers, load balancer, and then test the load balancer.
+ [Deploy Azure Application Gateway](https://mslabs.cloudguides.com/guides/AZ-700%20Lab%20Simulation%20-%20Deploy%20Azure%20Application%20Gateway). Create an application gateway, create virtual machines, create the backend pool, and test the gateway.
+ [Implement traffic management](https://mslabs.cloudguides.com/guides/AZ-104%20Exam%20Guide%20-%20Microsoft%20Azure%20Administrator%20Exercise%2010). Implement complete hub and spoke network including virtual machines, virtual networks, peering, load balancer, and application gateway.
  
## Lab objectives
In this lab, you will complete the following tasks:
+ Task 1: Use a template to provision an infrastructure.

   ![](../Labs/media/az-x1.png)

   >**Note:** Replace the frontend IP address with the IP address you copied in the previous step.

1. Start another browser window and test this URL - `<frontend ip address>/video/` and  verify you are directed to the video server (vm2).

### Review

In this lab, you have completed the following:

- Used an Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template to automate the provisioning of the infrastructure.
- Configured an Azure Load Balancer to distribute incoming traffic across multiple resources for high availability and reliability.
- Set up an Azure Application Gateway to enable advanced traffic routing, SSL termination, and web application firewall protection.


## Extend your learning with Copilot

Copilot can assist you in learning how to use the Azure scripting tools. Copilot can also assist in areas not covered in the lab or where you need more information. Open an Edge browser and choose Copilot (top right) or navigate to *copilot.microsoft.com*. Take a few minutes to try these prompts.

+ Compare and contrast the Azure Load Balancer with the Azure Application Gateway. Help me decide in which scenarios I should use each product. 
+ What tools are available to troubleshoot connections to an Azure Load Balancer? 
+ What are the basic steps for configuring the Azure Application Gateway? Provide a high-level checklist. 
+ Create a table highlighting three Azure load balancing solutions. For each solution show supported protocols, routing policies, session affinity, and TLS offloading.

Discuss the different load balancers in Azure and how to choose the right Azure load balancer solution to meet your requirements.
+ [Load balance your web service traffic with Application Gateway](https://learn.microsoft.com/training/modules/load-balance-web-traffic-with-application-gateway/). Improve application resilience by distributing load across multiple servers and use path-based routing to direct web traffic.

## Key takeaways

Congratulations on completing the lab. Here are the key points for this lab.

+ Azure Load Balancer is an excellent choice for distributing network traffic across multiple virtual machines at the transport layer (OSI layer 4 - TCP and UDP).
+ Public Load Balancers are used to load balance internet traffic to your VMs. An internal (or private) load balancer is used where private IPs are needed at the frontend only.
+ The Basic load balancer is for small-scale applications that don't need high availability or redundancy. The Standard load balancer is for high performance and ultra-low latency.
+ Azure Application Gateway is a web traffic (OSI layer 7) load balancer that enables you to manage traffic to your web applications.
+ The Application Gateway Standard tier offers all the L7 functionality, including load balancing, The WAF tier adds a firewall to check for malicious traffic.
+ An Application Gateway can make routing decisions based on additional attributes of an HTTP request, for example URI path or host headers.
