# Lab 05 - Implement Intersite Connectivity

## Lab Overview
 
 In this lab, you will set up and configure a virtual network, create subnets to organize resources, and implement network security through Network Security Groups (NSGs). 

## Lab objectives
In this lab, you will complete the following tasks:
+ Task 1: Provision the lab environment.
+ Task 2: Use Network Watcher to test the connection between virtual machines.
+ Task 3: Configure local and global virtual network peering.
+ Task 4: Test intersite connectivity.

## Exercise 1: Configure local and global virtual network peering

   Configure local and global virtual network peering to enable secure communication between Azure VNets, both within the same region (local) and across different regions (global).

### Task 1: Provision the lab environment

In this task, you will deploy three virtual machines, each into a separate virtual network, with two of them in the same Azure region and the third one in another Azure region.
   
1. In the Azure portal, open the **Azure Cloud Shell** by clicking on the icon in the top right of the Azure Portal.

    ![Image](./Images/cloudshell.png)

1. When prompted to select either **Bash** or **PowerShell**, select **PowerShell**. 

    >**Did you know?**  If you mostly work with Linux systems, Bash (CLI) feels more familiar. If you mostly work with Windows systems, Azure PowerShell feels more familiar. 

1. On the **Getting Started** screen select **Mount Storage Account**, select the storage account subscription from drop down and click on **Apply**

1. On mount storage account page, select **I want to create a storage account**. click on Next.

1. Provide the below details to create the storage account and click on **Create**.

    
    | Settings | Values |
    |  -- | -- |
    | Resource Group | **az104-05-rg0-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" />** |
    | Storage account (Create new) | **str<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" />** |
    | Region | **<inject key="Region" enableCopy="false" />** |
    | File share (Create new) | **none** |

     >**Note:** As you work with the Cloud Shell a storage account and file share is required. 

1. In the toolbar of the Cloud Shell pane, click on the **Manage files** dropdown, click **Upload** and upload the files **C:\AllFiles\AZ-104-MicrosoftAzureAdministrator-Lab-Files\Allfiles\Labs\05\\az104-05-vnetvm-loop-template.json** and **C:\AllFiles\AZ-104-MicrosoftAzureAdministrator-Lab-Files\Allfiles\Labs\05\\az104-05-vnetvm-loop-parameters.json** into the Cloud Shell home directory.

    ![Image](./Images/az10498.png)

1. From the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to use the resource group that will be hosting the lab environment. The first two virtual networks and a pair of virtual machines will be deployed in `Azure_region_1`. The third virtual network and the third virtual machine will be deployed in the same resource group but another `Azure_region_2`. (Replace the `[Azure_region_1]` and `[Azure_region_2]` placeholder, including the square brackets, with the names of two different Azure regions where you intend to deploy these Azure virtual machines). An example is $location1 = 'eastus'. 

   ```powershell
   $location1 = 'Azure_region_1'

   $location2 = 'Azure_region_2'

   $rgName = 'az104-05-rg0-Deployment-id'
   ```

   >**Note**: In order to identify Azure regions, from the PowerShell session in Cloud Shell, run **(Get-AzLocation).Location** command.

   >**Important**: Replace Deployment-id with **<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" />**.
   
   >**Note**: If you get a prompt stating **Provided resource group already exists. Are you sure you want to update it?** type N .

1. From the Cloud Shell pane, run the following to create the three virtual networks and deploy virtual machines into them by using the template and parameter files you uploaded:

   ```powershell
   New-AzResourceGroupDeployment `
      -ResourceGroupName $rgName `
      -TemplateFile $HOME/az104-05-vnetvm-loop-template.json `
      -TemplateParameterFile $HOME/az104-05-vnetvm-loop-parameters.json `
      -location1 $location1 `
      -location2 $location2
   ```

    >**Important**: You will be prompted to provide an admin password. Enter your own Password or give **Pa55w.rd1234**.
    
    >**Note**: Wait for the deployment to complete before proceeding to the next step. This should take about 2 minutes.

1. Close the Cloud Shell pane.

## Task 2: Use Network Watcher to test the connection between virtual machines 

In this task, you verify that resources in peered virtual networks can communicate with each other. Network Watcher will be used to test the connection. Before continuing, ensure both virtual machines have been deployed and are running. 

1. From the Azure portal, search for and select **Network Watcher**.

1. From Network Watcher, in the Network diagnostic tools menu in the left navigation pane, select **Connection troubleshoot**.

1. Use the following information to complete the fields on the **Connection troubleshoot** page and select **Run diagnostic tests** (8).

    | Field | Value | 
    | --- | --- |
    | Source type           | **Virtual machine** (1)  |
    | Virtual machine       | **az104-05-vm0**  (2) | 
    | Destination type      | **Virtual machine** (3)  |
    | Virtual machine       | **az104-05-vm1**  (4) | 
    | Preferred IP Version  | **Both**  (5)            | 
    | Protocol              | **TCP**    (6)           |
    | Destination port      | `3389`     (7)           |  
    | Source port           | *Blank*         |
    | Diagnostic tests      | *Defaults*      |
